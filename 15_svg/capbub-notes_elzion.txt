#1
Display a table with two rows and three columns
Clicking on any cell will display an alert with the contents of that cell

#2
Display a table with two rows and three columns
Clicking on any cell will display an alert with the contents of that cell, then
the contents of the row, and finally the contents of the table
Alerts display from innermost to outermost

#3
Display a table with two rows and three columns
Order changed after adding a true parameter
Shows table then cell then row
Seems like the function goes from the outermost html to the innermost but will
display from innermost to outmost unless specified otherwise
The stopPropagation function stops the alert after one pass (the first alert)

#4
Display a table with two rows and three columns
Clicking on any cell will display an alert with the contents of the table, then
the contents of the row, and finally the the contents of that cell
stopPropagation makes it so that only the first alert is displayed
The orders that the event listeners are attached does not matter
